# Db2 Data Management Console Preview Examples
The Jupyter Notebook in the project contains examples of how to use the Open APIs and composable interface that is available in the Db2 Data Management Console Technical Preview. Everything in the User Interface is also available through an open and fully documented RESTful Services API. You can find the full documentation in the Help included with the Db2 Data Management Console. 

The technical preview also lets you embed elements of the full user interface into an IFrame by constructing the appropriate URL. The sample notebooks include examples of how to do this.
